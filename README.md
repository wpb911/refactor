# Refactor project of the Horiseon site

This is an SEO-refactor project to make the site more accessible and therefore be ranked higher and more accurately by search engines and web crawlers. 

## Enhancements 

The .html file has been updated with alt tags to make it more accessible. Semantic tags have been used in place of the div tags allowing readers to better present the page for accessibility and allow the context to be better determined at the same time. The CSS code has been consolidated with like selectors and properties being combined following the semantic layout of the HTML file. Each section of the code has been commented to further explain its usage.

## Usage

When viewing the page a sample rendering looks like [refractor screenshot.](./assets/images/refactor.png)
